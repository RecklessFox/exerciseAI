<h1> Hello fellow user! Here you can generate an entire song and album covers, in the style of Taylor Swift! We just need some spark of creativity from your side, by providing us with the first 2 verses of the song. The rest is up to us!</h2>
    <p1> To generate the lyrics given the first 2 verses, input localhost:8000/inferText/{verse1;verse2}. This shouldn't take more than 30 segs! </p1>
    <br>
    <p1> To generate your album cover with a custom theme, input localhost:8000/inferImage/{your custom theme/name}. This can take a while (especially on the first time), depending on how performant my GPU is! </p1>
